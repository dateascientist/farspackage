farspackage
===========

The goal of farspackage was to develop and upload a package for Week \#4 of the Coursera course Building R Packages (part of the Mastering Software Development in R Specialization).

The *farspackage* contains various functions to read from file, summarize, and map data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)

This data encompasses the yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

Installation
------------

This package can be installed and loaded with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ilikefishes/farspackage")
library(farspackage)
```

For more information on functionality and usage, please view the included vignette or documentation.
